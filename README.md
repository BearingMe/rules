# Contributing to Projects

Welcome to BlockLabz Rules! This repository contains guidelines for contributing to our projects, so that everyone can participate in making our code better. Whether you're new to open-source development or a seasoned veteran, we hope that this guide will be helpful in getting you started.

To contribute to our projects, read the [Contribution Guidelines][contributors_guide] and [Code of Conduct][code_of_conduct]. These documents outline the standards we expect from our contributors and provide helpful tips on how to make the most of your contributions. You may want to check our [Commit Style Guide][conventional_commits] that you can use to ensure your code matches the rest of the project.

We also follow [Semantic Versioning][semantic_versioning], which means that we use version numbers to communicate the level of change in each release. This helps users understand whether a new version will be compatible with their existing code, and helps us ensure that we're releasing stable, well-tested code. Take a look if you want to, it's not mandatory.

And well, that's it. Thank you for any future contributions to our projects, being big and small. Whether you're fixing a typo or adding a new feature, we're excited to have you on board. Feel free to reach us if you have any questions, we'll do our best to help.
