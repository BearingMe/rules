# Welcome to BlockLabz! 🚀

This is our rules section, where we keep guides on how to contribute to our project 🧐

## Getting Started
- 📖 If you are new to the open source world, please read our [Contribution Guidelines][contributors_guide]. This document is going to teach you how to make your first pull request.  
- 💻 Want to write some code? Ensure your commit matches the rest of the project. Follow our [Commit Style Guide][conventional_commits].
- 📈 You can also take a look at how we version our releases. It's not mandatory, but it's always nice to learn something new. Check the [Semantic Versioning][semantic_versioning] guide.
- 🎖️ Are you already a veteran? Then take a look at our [Code of Conduct][code_of_conduct] to stay on top of our responsibilities.
- 💡 Any good idea? Send it to us, so that everyone can participate in making our code better. 

Well, that's it for now. This article will soon be expanded as we make progress in others documentations.  
 
Thanks for joining us, and let's make something awesome together!
